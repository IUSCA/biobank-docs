# Data Browser

The Data Browser is a powerful component of the AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal that allows researchers to explore files, datasets, phenotypes, and metadata available within the system.

## Overview

The Data Browser provides a comprehensive interface for discovering and understanding the data resources available through the AnalytiXIN platform. It allows you to:

- Browse available datasets and their metadata
- Explore phenotypic data elements
- Search for specific data types or attributes
- View data dictionaries and documentation
- Understand data provenance and quality metrics

## Using the Data Browser

### Navigating Datasets

The Data Browser organizes information into several categories:

- **Genomic Data**: Sequencing files, variant calls, and annotations
- **Clinical Data**: Electronic health record data, diagnoses, procedures, and medications
- **Phenotypic Data**: Structured phenotype information and measurements
- **Biospecimen Data**: Sample metadata and quality metrics
- **Derived Data**: Processed datasets and analysis results

### Search Functionality

The Data Browser offers powerful search capabilities:

- **Keyword Search**: Find datasets containing specific terms
- **Attribute Search**: Filter by data attributes such as data type, format, or source
- **Advanced Filters**: Combine multiple criteria for precise dataset discovery
- **Saved Searches**: Save and reuse common search patterns

### Data Exploration

Once you've identified datasets of interest, you can:

- View detailed metadata and documentation
- Examine data dictionaries and field descriptions
- Preview data summaries and distributions
- Check data availability and access requirements
- Understand relationships between different datasets

## Integration with Other Tools

The Data Browser is fully integrated with other components of the AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal:

- **Cohort Builder**: Use discovered data elements as filters in cohort definition
- **Variant Xplorer**: Link directly to relevant genomic datasets
- **Secure Enclave**: Request access to datasets for analysis in the secure environment

This integration enables seamless workflows from data discovery to analysis, supporting efficient research processes.

## Data Governance and Access

The Data Browser displays information about data governance and access requirements for each dataset:

- Access tiers and requirements
- Data use limitations
- Citation requirements
- Version information and update history

This transparency helps researchers understand what data is available and how it can be accessed and used for their research projects.
