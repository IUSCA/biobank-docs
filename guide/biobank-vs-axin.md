# Indiana Biobank vs. AnalytiXIN

The Indiana Biobank and AnalytiXIN (also referred to as AnalytixIndiana) are closely connected but serve distinct purposes:

## Indiana Biobank

- Manages participant recruitment and recall, sample collection, and sample management

- Maintains a dedicated instance of the research data portal for academic researchers and other collaborators

- Facilitates internal access to detailed biospecimen and clinical/genomic datasets for Indiana Biobank-approved projects

- Participant Viewer: Visualize and drill into individual-level data

## AnalytiXIN

- An Indiana statewide consortium

- Provides industry and academic partners with limited, de-identified subsets of Indiana Biobank data and EHR data from other data contributors, such as IU Health

- Serves as a collaborative gateway for industry to work with researchers at Indiana universities

- Enables joint research opportunities, where full access may be granted through partnerships

This distinction ensures appropriate data governance and access control for both academic and commercial uses.
