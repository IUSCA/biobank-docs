# Indiana Biobank vs. AnalytiXIN

The Indiana Biobank and AnalytiXIN run the same research portal software and work with very similar data, but they are separate instances with different datasets loaded. The primary reason for this distinction is that datasets are governed by different terms of use — some are available only for academic research, others under terms that also permit commercial use. Each instance loads the datasets appropriate to its user base.

## Indiana Biobank

The Indiana Biobank manages participant recruitment, sample collection, and sample management. Its portal instance is for academic researchers and collaborators, and loads datasets available under academic research terms.

**Who can access the cohort browser:** Any registered user

**Who can access participant-level data:** Dependent on the collaboration agreement under which the genomic data was generated

**How to request access:** Submit a data access request through the portal with a summary of your research objectives. See [Requesting Data Access](/guide/cohort-builder.md#requesting-data-access) for the full process.

## AnalytiXIN

AnalytiXIN is an Indiana statewide consortium providing academic and industry partners with de-identified clinical and genomic data from the Indiana Biobank and other contributors such as IU Health. Its portal instance loads datasets available under terms that permit both academic and commercial use, making it suitable for industry-partnered research.
