# What is AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal?

The AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal is a comprehensive platform that enables researchers to explore, build cohorts, and access multi-modal clinical and genomic data collected from a diverse patient population across Indiana.

## Purpose and Mission

The AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal serves as a bridge between researchers and the rich clinical and genomic data resources available through the Indiana Biobank. Its mission is to:

- Accelerate biomedical research and discovery
- Enable precision medicine approaches
- Facilitate collaboration between academic and industry partners
- Provide secure and compliant access to valuable health data
- Support Indiana's growing life sciences ecosystem

## Key Features

### Data Resources

The portal provides access to:

- Genomic sequencing data (whole genome, exome, targeted panels)
- Clinical data from electronic health records
- Demographic information
- Longitudinal health outcomes
- Biospecimen metadata

### Research Tools

Researchers can leverage:

- **Cohort Builder**: Create and refine patient cohorts based on clinical and genomic criteria
- **Data Browser**: Explore available datasets, files, and metadata
- **Variant Xplorer**: Investigate genetic variants and their distributions
- **Secure Enclave**: Analyze sensitive data in a protected environment

## AnalytiXIN and Indiana Biobank

The AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal is part of the broader AnalytiXIN initiative, a statewide consortium that provides industry and academic partners with access to de-identified subsets of Indiana Biobank data and EHR data from other contributors.

While the Indiana Biobank focuses on participant recruitment, sample collection, and sample management, AnalytiXIN serves as a collaborative gateway for industry to work with researchers at Indiana universities.

## Access and Availability

The AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal is available to qualified researchers from academic institutions, healthcare organizations, and industry partners. Access to different levels of data is governed by data use agreements and research protocols.
