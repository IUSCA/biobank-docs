# What is {{PLATFORM_FULL_NAME}}?

{{PLATFORM_FULL_NAME}} is a research portal for exploring multi-modal clinical and genomic data collected from a diverse patient population across Indiana. It is designed for researchers who need to identify participant cohorts, investigate genetic variants, and access data for analysis.

## What You Can Do

- **Browse available data** — explore what diagnoses, lab tests, medications, and genomic variants are present in the dataset before committing to a research question ([Data Browser](/guide/data-browser.md))
- **Build cohorts** — define groups of participants using clinical and genomic criteria, then request access to their data ([Cohort Builder](/guide/cohort-builder.md))
- **Investigate variants** — search and filter genetic variants across the participant population ([Variant Xplorer](/guide/variant-explorer.md))
- **Analyze data** — work with approved cohort data inside a secure, controlled environment ([Trusted Research Environment](/guide/trusted-research-environment-setup.md))
- **Access data programmatically** — use the CLI or API to retrieve data as part of automated workflows ([API Client](/guide/api-client.md))

## Who Has Access

The portal is available to qualified researchers from academic institutions, healthcare organizations, and industry partners. Access to participant-level data is governed by data use agreements and research protocols.

To request access, [create an account](/guide/getting-started.md) and submit a data access request through the Cohort Builder once you've defined your research cohort.
