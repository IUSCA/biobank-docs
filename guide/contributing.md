## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **User-focused**: Write from the user's perspective
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout the documentation
- **Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice

### Markdown Formatting

The documentation uses standard Markdown with some VitePress-specific features:

#### Headers
```markdown
# Main Title (H1)
## Section Title (H2)
### Subsection Title (H3)
```

#### Code Blocks
```markdown
```bash
npm install
```
```

#### Images
```markdown
![Alt text](../public/images/filename.png)
```

#### Links
```markdown
[Link text](./other-page.md)
[External link](https://example.com)
```

#### Global Variables
The documentation uses global variables for platform-specific terms:
```markdown
{{PLATFORM_FULL_NAME}}
{{PLATFORM_NAME}}
{{WEBSITE_URL}}
{{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}
```

### File Organization

- **Guide pages**: Place user-facing documentation in the `guide/` directory
- **API documentation**: Place technical API docs in the `api/` directory
- **Images**: Store images in `public/images/` with descriptive filenames
- **Screenshots**: Organize screenshots in `public/images/screenshots/`

### Adding New Pages

When creating new pages:

1. **Create the file**: Add your `.md` file in the appropriate directory
2. **Update navigation**: Add the page to the relevant index file (e.g., `guide/index.md`)
3. **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the existing page structure
4. **Add appropriate metadata**: Include relevant frontmatter if needed
