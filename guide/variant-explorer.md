# Variant Xplorer

Variant Xplorer lets you search and filter genetic variants across the {{ORGANIZATION}} participant population.

## Two Ways to Use Variant Xplorer

**Standalone** — open Variant Xplorer directly to start a new search from scratch. Use this when you have a specific variant, gene, or region in mind and want to explore what's present in the participant population.

**From the Cohort Builder** — when building a Genotype Cohort, an embedded version of Variant Xplorer appears inline. Use it to define your variant criteria, then save the results as a cohort. You can also expand out to the full Variant Xplorer view from within the Cohort Builder.

## Searching for Variants

Enter a query in any of these forms:

- Genomic coordinates (e.g., `chr7:140453136`)
- Gene symbol (e.g., `BRAF`)
- rsID (e.g., `rs113488022`)

## Filtering Results

Narrow your results using:

- **Variant type** — SNV, indel, structural variant
- **Allele frequency** — set thresholds to focus on rare or common variants
- **Predicted impact** — high, moderate, or low functional impact
- **Functional annotations** — consequence terms, conservation scores, pathogenicity predictions

## Building a Genotype Cohort from Results

Once you have a set of variants of interest, use the Cohort Builder to define a Genotype Cohort based on those criteria. Participants carrying those variants will be included in the cohort.

See [Cohort Builder — Building a Genotype Cohort](/guide/cohort-builder.md#building-a-genotype-cohort) for the full workflow.
