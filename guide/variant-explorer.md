## Overview

Variant Xplorer provides an interface for exploring genomic data, allowing you to:

- Search for specific genetic variants by position, gene, or variant ID
- Filter results using variant annotations and predicted functional impacts
- Correlate variants with phenotypic data (Using [Cohort Builder](./cohort-builder.md))

## Using Variant Xplorer

### Searching for Variants

You can search for variants using:

- Genomic coordinates (e.g., chr7:140453136)
- Gene symbols (e.g., BRAF)
- rsIDs (e.g., rs113488022)


### Filtering Options

Variant Xplorer offers various filtering options to narrow down your search:

- Variant type (SNV, indel, structural variant)
- Allele frequency thresholds
- Predicted impact (high, moderate, low)
- Conservation scores
- Functional annotations

## Integration with Cohort Builder

Variant Xplorer is integrated with the Cohort Builder, allowing you to define cohorts based on specific genetic variants.

This integration enables powerful genotype-phenotype analyses and facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant genetic associations.
