# Variant Xplorer

The Variant Xplorer is a specialized tool within the AnalytiXIN Clinical Genomic Portal that allows researchers to investigate genetic variants and their distributions across the Indiana Biobank participant population.

## Overview

Variant Xplorer provides a comprehensive interface for exploring genomic data, allowing you to:

- Search for specific genetic variants by position, gene, or variant ID
- Visualize variant frequencies across different cohorts
- Examine variant annotations and predicted functional impacts
- Correlate variants with phenotypic data
- Export variant statistics for further analysis

## Using Variant Xplorer

### Searching for Variants

You can search for variants using:

- Genomic coordinates (e.g., chr7:140453136)
- Gene symbols (e.g., BRAF)
- rsIDs (e.g., rs113488022)


### Filtering Options

Variant Xplorer offers various filtering options to narrow down your search:

- Variant type (SNV, indel, structural variant)
- Allele frequency thresholds
- Predicted impact (high, moderate, low)
- Conservation scores
- Functional annotations

### Visualization Features

The tool provides several visualization options:

- Variant distribution plots
- Genotype-phenotype correlation charts
- Population frequency comparisons
- Protein domain mapping

## Integration with Cohort Builder

Variant Xplorer is fully integrated with the Cohort Builder, allowing you to:

1. Define cohorts based on specific genetic variants
2. Analyze variant frequencies within custom cohorts
3. Compare variant distributions between different cohorts
4. Use variants as filters in cohort definition

This integration enables powerful genotype-phenotype analyses and facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant genetic associations.
