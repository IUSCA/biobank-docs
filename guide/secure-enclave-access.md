# Secure Enclave Access

## What is a Secure Enclave?

A secure enclave is a controlled computing environment that enforces strict data access, auditing, and computational restrictions. It ensures compliance with regulatory and ethical standards while minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure or misuse.

## Why is it Necessary?

Using a secure enclave is necessary when working with deidentified Indiana Biobank participant clinical data alongside raw genomic sequencing information. This approach:

- Protects sensitive participant data
- Ensures compliance with data use agreements
- Maintains regulatory compliance
- Provides a controlled environment for analysis
- Prevents unauthorized data export

## How to Access the Secure Enclave

### Prerequisites

Before requesting access to the secure enclave, you must:

1. Create a cohort in the Indiana Biobank Research Portal
3. Prepare a formal request detailing your research objectives and data needs

### Request Process

1. Submit a formal request to access participant-level clinical, phenotype, and genomic data for your locked cohort
2. Your request will be reviewed by the data governance committee
3. Upon approval, you will receive credentials and instructions for accessing the secure enclave
4. You can then conduct analyses within the enclave environment in compliance with data governance and privacy protections

### Working in the Secure Enclave

The secure enclave provides:

- A suite of pre-installed analysis tools
- Access to high-performance computing resources
- Ability to install additional packages (subject to approval)
- Collaboration features for team-based research
- Export controls for results and aggregated data

## Data Export Policies

While raw data cannot be exported from the secure enclave, researchers can export:

- Analysis results
- Statistical summaries
- Aggregated data
- Visualizations
- Code and analysis workflows

All exports are subject to review to ensure they do not contain identifiable information.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How long does data access approval take?

The approval process timeline varies depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the data being requested. Typically, you can expect a response within 2-4 weeks.

### Can I export raw data to my local environment?

No. For security and compliance reasons, raw data must be analyzed within the secure enclave environment. However, you can export analysis results and aggregated data that do not contain identifiable information.
