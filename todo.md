- HGVS notation (e.g., NM_004333.4:c.1799T>A) ? 
- Visualize variant frequencies across different cohorts

- Export variant statistics for further analysis

### Visualization Features

The tool provides several visualization options:

- Variant distribution plots
- Genotype-phenotype correlation charts
- Population frequency comparisons
- Protein domain mapping

2. Analyze variant frequencies within custom cohorts
3. Compare variant distributions between different cohorts
4. Use variants as filters in cohort definition


## Security and Best Practices

### Security Guidelines

**Account Security:**
- Never share your secure enclave credentials with anyone
- Use your credentials only for authorized research purposes
- Report any suspected security incidents immediately
- Log out completely when finished with your session

**Data Handling:**
- Only access data relevant to your approved research
- Do not attempt to identify participants from the data
- Follow all data use agreement requirements
- Report any data quality issues through proper channels

**Network Security:**
- Access the enclave only from secure, trusted networks
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive work
- Use institutional networks when possible
- Be aware that all activities are logged and monitored

### Best Practices for Productive Work

**Session Management:**
- Plan your work sessions in advance
- Use screen or tmux for long-running analyses
- Save work frequently and use descriptive filenames
- Keep detailed notes of your analysis steps

**Collaboration:**
- Coordinate with team members to avoid conflicts
- Use shared directories for collaborative work
- Document your code and analysis workflows
- Follow naming conventions for shared files

**Resource Management:**
- Monitor your resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space)
- Clean up temporary files regularly
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Contact support if you need additional resources

### Getting Help

**Technical Support:**
- Use the built-in help documentation first
- Check for system status updates
- Contact support for technical issues
- Provide detailed error messages when reporting problems

**Research Support:**
- Consult with biostatisticians for analysis guidance
- Reach out to domain experts for data interpretation
- Use institutional research support services
- Participate in user training sessions when available


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How long does data access approval take?

The approval process timeline varies depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the data being requested. Typically, you can expect a response within 2-4 weeks.

### Can I export raw data to my local environment?

No. For security and compliance reasons, raw data must be analyzed within the secure enclave environment. However, you can export analysis results and aggregated data that do not contain identifiable information.
